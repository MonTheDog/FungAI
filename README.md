# FungAI

A small Machine Learning Project with a focus on Explainability and Model Comparisons. </br>
Developed for the Machine Learning course at UNISA
</br>
The Dataset I used was taken from UC Irvine archives: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom. </br>
The resultant CSV is called "mushroom.csv"
</br>
For the Machine Learning pipeline please refer to "pipeline.py" </br>
For the explainability and driver code please refer to "driver.py" </br>
For the final model please refer to "Decision_Tree.pickle" </br>
For the evaluation scores please refer to "scores.csv" </br>
</br>
The resultant web application can be tested and used at: https://fungai.streamlit.app/ </br>
</br>
All the graphs can be found under the "images" directory, while the documentation file is called "FungAI_Documentation.pdf" and can be found in the root directory
