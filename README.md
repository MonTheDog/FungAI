# FungAI

A small Machine Learning Project with a focus on Explainability and Model Comparisons.
Developed for the Machine Learning course at UNISA

The Dataset I used was taken from UC Irvine archives: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom.
The resultant CSV is called "mushroom.csv"

For the Machine Learning pipeline please refer to "pipeline.py"
For the explainability and driver code please refer to "driver.py"
For the final model please refer to "Decision_Tree.pickle"
For the evaluation scores please refer to "scores.csv"

The resultant web application can be tested and used at: https://fungai.streamlit.app/

All the graphs can be found under the "images" directory, while the documentation file is called "FungAI_Documentation.pdf" and can be found in the root directory
